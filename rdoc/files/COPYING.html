            <pre>               GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#x000A;                   Version 3, 29 June 2007&#x000A;&#x000A; Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;&#x000A; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#x000A; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates&#x000A;the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public&#x000A;License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.&#x000A;&#x000A;  0. Additional Definitions.&#x000A;&#x000A;  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser&#x000A;General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU&#x000A;General Public License.&#x000A;&#x000A;  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,&#x000A;other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&#x000A;&#x000A;  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided&#x000A;by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.&#x000A;Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode&#x000A;of using an interface provided by the Library.&#x000A;&#x000A;  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an&#x000A;Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library&#x000A;with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked&#x000A;Version&quot;.&#x000A;&#x000A;  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#x000A;Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code&#x000A;for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are&#x000A;based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#x000A;&#x000A;  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#x000A;object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data&#x000A;and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the&#x000A;Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#x000A;&#x000A;  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#x000A;&#x000A;  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License&#x000A;without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#x000A;&#x000A;  2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#x000A;&#x000A;  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a&#x000A;facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application&#x000A;that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the&#x000A;facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified&#x000A;version:&#x000A;&#x000A;   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to&#x000A;   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the&#x000A;   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs&#x000A;   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#x000A;&#x000A;   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of&#x000A;   this License applicable to that copy.&#x000A;&#x000A;  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#x000A;&#x000A;  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from&#x000A;a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object&#x000A;code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated&#x000A;material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure&#x000A;layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates&#x000A;(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#x000A;&#x000A;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the&#x000A;   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#x000A;   covered by this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#x000A;   document.&#x000A;&#x000A;  4. Combined Works.&#x000A;&#x000A;  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,&#x000A;taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the&#x000A;portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse&#x000A;engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of&#x000A;the following:&#x000A;&#x000A;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that&#x000A;   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#x000A;   covered by this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#x000A;   document.&#x000A;&#x000A;   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during&#x000A;   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among&#x000A;   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the&#x000A;   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#x000A;&#x000A;   d) Do one of the following:&#x000A;&#x000A;       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this&#x000A;       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form&#x000A;       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to&#x000A;       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of&#x000A;       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the&#x000A;       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying&#x000A;       Corresponding Source.&#x000A;&#x000A;       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#x000A;       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time&#x000A;       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer&#x000A;       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version&#x000A;       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked&#x000A;       Version.&#x000A;&#x000A;   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise&#x000A;   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the&#x000A;   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is&#x000A;   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the&#x000A;   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the&#x000A;   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If&#x000A;   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany&#x000A;   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application&#x000A;   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation&#x000A;   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL&#x000A;   for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#x000A;&#x000A;  5. Combined Libraries.&#x000A;&#x000A;  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#x000A;Library side by side in a single library together with other library&#x000A;facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this&#x000A;License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your&#x000A;choice, if you do both of the following:&#x000A;&#x000A;   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based&#x000A;   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,&#x000A;   conveyed under the terms of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it&#x000A;   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the&#x000A;   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#x000A;&#x000A;  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&#x000A;&#x000A;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#x000A;of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new&#x000A;versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may&#x000A;differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#x000A;Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version&#x000A;of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;&#x000A;applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and&#x000A;conditions either of that published version or of any later version&#x000A;published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you&#x000A;received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser&#x000A;General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser&#x000A;General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#x000A;&#x000A;  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide&#x000A;whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall&#x000A;apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is&#x000A;permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the&#x000A;Library.</pre>
